# Classical 3D Reconstruction Demos

This package contains two educational demos illustrating classical (pre-deep learning) 3D reconstruction methods covered in the VIAR course.

## Demos Overview

### 1. Structure from Motion (SfM) - `demo_sfm_classical.py`

**Purpose**: Demonstrates the complete SfM pipeline from 2D feature correspondences to sparse 3D reconstruction.

**Pipeline Steps**:
1. **Feature Detection & Matching**: Establishes 2D correspondences between views
2. **Fundamental Matrix Estimation**: Uses RANSAC + 8-point algorithm to estimate epipolar geometry
3. **Essential Matrix & Pose Recovery**: Extracts relative camera pose (R, t)
4. **Triangulation**: Reconstructs 3D points from 2D correspondences
5. **Bundle Adjustment**: Jointly optimizes camera poses and 3D points

**Key Concepts Illustrated**:
- Epipolar geometry: x₂ᵀ F x₁ = 0
- RANSAC for robust estimation
- Direct Linear Transform (DLT) for triangulation
- Non-linear optimization (Levenberg-Marquardt)
- Scale ambiguity in monocular reconstruction

**Output**: 
- Visualization showing feature matches, inliers/outliers
- 3D sparse point cloud reconstruction
- Ground truth vs reconstructed comparison
- Quantitative error metrics before/after bundle adjustment

---

### 2. Multi-View Stereo (MVS) - `demo_mvs_classical.py`

**Purpose**: Demonstrates dense reconstruction from sparse SfM using photometric consistency.

**Pipeline Steps**:
1. **Scene Generation**: Creates textured 3D surface with depth variation
2. **Sparse SfM Simulation**: Generates sparse point cloud (simulating SfM output)
3. **Cost Volume Construction**: Builds 3D cost volume using NCC matching
4. **Depth Map Estimation**: Per-pixel depth selection via winner-takes-all
5. **Depth Fusion**: Merges multiple depth maps into dense point cloud

**Key Concepts Illustrated**:
- Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) for photometric consistency
- Cost volume aggregation across multiple views
- Depth hypothesis sampling
- Confidence-based filtering
- Dense reconstruction (10-100x more points than SfM)

**Output**:
- Rendered images from multiple viewpoints
- Per-view depth maps (color-coded)
- Confidence maps showing matching quality
- Sparse vs dense 3D comparison
- Densification statistics

## Understanding the Outputs

### SfM Demo Visualization (`sfm_demo_results.png`)

The output figure contains 6 subplots:

1. **Top-Left**: Camera 1 feature points (blue dots)
2. **Top-Center**: Camera 2 feature points (red dots)
3. **Top-Right**: Feature matches (green = inliers, red = outliers)
4. **Bottom-Left**: Ground truth 3D scene with camera poses
5. **Bottom-Center**: SfM reconstruction before bundle adjustment
6. **Bottom-Right**: Overlay comparison (GT vs reconstructed)

**What to observe**:
- RANSAC successfully identifies inliers (typically 80-95% of matches)
- Triangulated 3D points approximate ground truth
- Bundle adjustment reduces reprojection errors
- Camera poses (black triangles) are recovered correctly

---

### MVS Demo Visualization (`mvs_demo_results.png`)

The output figure contains 4 rows:

**Row 1**: Input images from 3 cameras (grayscale textured)
**Row 2**: Depth maps (color-coded, jet colormap)
  - Red = close to camera
  - Blue = far from camera
  
**Row 3**: Confidence maps (NCC scores)
  - Yellow/Green = high confidence (good texture match)
  - Purple/Blue = low confidence (ambiguous or textureless)
  
**Row 4**: 3D reconstructions
  - Left: Sparse SfM (~1000 points)
  - Center: Dense MVS (~10,000-15,000 points)
  - Right: Overlay comparison

**What to observe**:
- Depth maps capture surface geometry with depth variations
- Confidence is high in textured regions, low in uniform areas
- Dense reconstruction fills in most visible surface points
- MVS produces 10-100x more points than sparse SfM

## Educational Goals

### Learning Objectives

After running these demos, students should understand:

1. **SfM Principles**:
   - How 2D correspondences constrain 3D geometry (epipolar constraint)
   - Why RANSAC is essential for robust estimation
   - The role of triangulation in recovering depth
   - How bundle adjustment refines the entire reconstruction
   - Scale ambiguity in monocular vision

2. **MVS Principles**:
   - Photometric consistency as a matching criterion
   - Cost volume construction and aggregation
   - Depth hypothesis testing
   - The difference between sparse (SfM) and dense (MVS) reconstruction
   - Why texture is crucial for stereo matching

3. **Classical vs Deep Learning Methods**:
   - Classical methods are interpretable and geometrically principled
   - Hand-crafted features (SIFT) vs learned features (CNNs)
   - Explicit optimization vs end-to-end learning
   - When classical methods fail (textureless, reflective, thin structures)

---

## Customization & Experimentation

### Experiment Ideas

**SfM Demo**:
1. **Add more noise**: Increase `noise_std` in `add_noise_to_points()`
2. **Add outliers**: Manually corrupt some correspondences
3. **Change camera baseline**: Modify translation `t2` (larger baseline = better depth accuracy)
4. **Vary number of points**: Change `n_points` in `generate_synthetic_scene()`

**MVS Demo**:
1. **Change depth sampling**: Modify `depth_samples` (trade-off: accuracy vs speed)
2. **Adjust patch size**: Change `patch_size` (larger = more robust, but smooths details)
3. **Test different textures**: Modify `create_synthetic_texture()` to add/remove patterns
4. **Add more cameras**: Extend the camera array for better reconstruction

### Key Parameters to Tune

**SfM**:
```python
# RANSAC parameters
threshold=3.0          # Inlier threshold (pixels)
n_iterations=1000      # RANSAC iterations

# Noise level
noise_std=0.5          # Gaussian noise (pixels)

# Camera baseline
t2 = np.array([1.5, 0, 0])  # Larger = better depth, but more occlusions
```

**MVS**:
```python
# Depth range
depth_min=3.0, depth_max=7.0    # Scene depth bounds

# Resolution
depth_samples=32                 # Number of depth hypotheses

# Matching
patch_size=7                     # NCC window size
confidence_threshold=0.3         # Minimum NCC to accept point
```

## Limitations of Classical Methods

These demos also illustrate common failure modes:

### SfM Failures:
- **Textureless surfaces**: No features to match (walls, sky)
- **Repetitive patterns**: Ambiguous correspondences
- **Dynamic scenes**: Moving objects violate static assumption
- **Specular surfaces**: Violate Lambertian reflectance

### MVS Failures:
- **Uniform regions**: NCC is ambiguous without texture
- **Thin structures**: Missed by discrete depth sampling
- **Occlusions**: Foreground/background confusion
- **View-dependent appearance**: Specular highlights, reflections

**Solution in modern methods**: Deep learning (CNNs) can learn robust features and matching functions that handle these cases better.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Import errors**:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'
```
**Solution**: Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`

**2. Slow execution (MVS demo)**:
```
Computing depth map takes > 5 minutes
```
**Solution**: 
- Reduce `depth_samples` (e.g., 16 instead of 32)
- Increase `step` in depth map computation (line 239)

**3. Poor reconstruction quality**:
- Check that `noise_std` is not too high
- Ensure sufficient texture in synthetic scene
- Verify camera baseline is appropriate for depth range

**4. Visualization issues**:
```
UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg...
```
**Solution**: This is normal for headless systems. Plots are still saved to disk.
