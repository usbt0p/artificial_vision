# Computer Vision
This repo contains materials and a final group project for the Computer Vision (Visión Artificial) course.

## Project

As a final project we chose to research different implementations of the U-Net architecture. We did this in a team of three and we pair programmed most of the time. You can find it on here: [session 04](../session04/labCode/)-
In the project, we studied the role of _skip connections_ in U-Net through ablations (concat/add/attention/none) and network depths (“bigger”), analyzing computational cost, stability, and performance (IoU/loss/gradient). We added graphs to support our conclusions well.

## Overview of the course subjects

These are all the codes for a subject called "Visión Artificial" (Computer Vision).
